# **Course: Python for Reliable AI-Embedded Applications**

---

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on opportunity to apply and integrate all the skills you’ve gained throughout this course. By working on a structured real-world challenge, you will design, develop, and test a Python-based AI-driven backend application using FastAPI that delivers meaningful, personalized recommendations to users.

This capstone project is designed to strengthen your understanding of modular Python programming, API development, data validation with Pydantic, asynchronous processing, LLM integration, context-aware logic, error handling, and testing. Completing this project will give you practical experience in building scalable, efficient, and intelligent backend systems.

-----

**Your task is to:**

1. Select the provided **project scenario** (e.g., Wellbeing Coach – Your Personalized 5-Minute Mental Booster).
2. Design the **application architecture**, defining modules, classes, routes, and data flow.
3. Develop a **FastAPI application** that implements:
    - Core endpoints for data input, recommendation, and feedback.
    - Data validation and structured API responses using **Pydantic models**.
    - **Integration with LLM APIs** for dynamic and personalized suggestions.
4. Implement **context-awareness** (e.g., location or user state) in your logic.
5. Apply robust **error handling** and ensure clean, modular code organization.
6. Write and execute **unit tests** for core routes and logic using pytest or FastAPI TestClient.

Prepare and present your final project demo, showcasing functionality and explaining the architecture, design, and AI integration approach.

**2.  Environment Setup**
- Initialize a **FastAPI project** and configure environment variables.  
- Set up dependencies (`uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `requests`, `dotenv`).  
- Create base folder structure (`routes`, `models`, `services`, `tests`).  

**3. Core API Development**
- Build essential **API endpoints** for core project functionalities.  
- Define **Pydantic models** for request/response validation.  
- Implement structured and meaningful JSON responses.  

**4. Context Awareness & LLM Integration**
- Integrate **LLM APIs (Gemini/Ollama)** for intelligent, context-aware recommendations.  
- Add **location-based context** for personalized outputs.  
- Handle async calls and manage error responses gracefully.  

**5. Data Handling & Error Management**
- Store and log user interactions and inputs.  
- Apply exception handling for failed API calls or invalid input.  
- Ensure fallback recommendations when data is missing.  

**6. Testing & Validation**
- Write **unit tests** using `pytest` or `FastAPI TestClient`.  
- Test route functionality, status codes, and validation logic.
- Refactor for code readability and maintainability.  

**7. Documentation and Presentation**  
- Prepare a detailed report documenting the design, features, and key learnings.  
- Deliver a **3–4 minute presentation**, including screenshots or a live demo.  

**8. Peer Review and Feedback (Optional)**  
- Share your project with peers for feedback.  
- Incorporate suggestions to refine your solution.  

**9. Submit Final Deliverables**  
- Ensure all code, documentation, and presentation files are well organized.  

**10. Reflect and Share**  
- Reflect on your learning experience and summarize key takeaways.  
- Optionally craft a **portfolio-ready summary** of your project.

## Guidelines for Success

🔹 **Start Early** – Initialize the FastAPI project, env vars, and folder structure in Sprint 11. 

🔹 **Keep It Simple** – Deliver core endpoints (detection, recommendation, logging) before adding extras.  

🔹 **Test Thoroughly** – Manually verify responses, then add `pytest` / `TestClient` tests for key routes.

🔹 **Focus on API UX** – Make responses predictable, well-documented (OpenAPI), and easy to consume. 

🔹 **Leverage Feedback** – Share API docs and Postman/Swagger samples with mentors for iterative refinement.

🔹 **Stay Organized** – Keep repo tidy, use meaningful commits, and document setup + run steps.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Think of this project as something you’d proudly showcase in an **interview portfolio**.
